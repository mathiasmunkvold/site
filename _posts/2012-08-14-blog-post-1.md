$$ f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $$
This is a sample blog post. Lorem ipsum I can't remember the rest of lorem ipsum and don't have an internet connection right now. Testing testing testing this blog post. Blog posts are cool.

Headings are cool

Aren't headings cool?

The **directional derivative** of a scalar function \( f(x, y, \dots) \) at a point \( \mathbf{p} \) in the direction of a unit vector \( \mathbf{u} \) is given by:

\[
D_{\mathbf{u}} f = \nabla f \cdot \mathbf{u} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(\mathbf{p} + h\mathbf{u}) - f(\mathbf{p})}{h}
\]

where:
- \( \nabla f \) is the gradient of \( f \),
- \( \mathbf{u} \) is a unit vector indicating the direction,
- \( \cdot \) denotes the dot product.

The directional derivative measures the rate of change of \( f \) at \( \mathbf{p} \) in the direction of \( \mathbf{u} \).
